### TEDxPenn ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§
TEDxPenn holds a special place in my heart purely because it's sole purpose is to spread knowledge without any ulterior motive. I love to learn for the sake of learning and enable that for other's too. It's what I did in my experience at the Director of Speaker & Content of TEDxPenn 2023 as I organised speaker recruitment and speech drafting. We were able to bring on board speakers like filmaker Anthony Russo, Pennsylvania State Representative Jordan Harris, and CNN Top 10 Hero Dr. Ala Stanford. This year, I'm the Co-Curator and I'm so excited to bring back the largest student-run conference in the US for another year. 

Oh and I also gave my own TEDx talk in the 8th grade - its a bit embarassing to watch it now but it was an essential part of my journey as a public speaker and a lover of the pursuit of knowledge.

### Physics Society, World Space Week & Penn Astronomical Student Association ‚≠êÔ∏è
I founded and led the Physics Society in my high school and our goal was to foster understanding about scientific phenomena in anyone and everyone interested. We did that by organizing educational stargazing sessions attended by 100 people, conducting a webinar on nanosatellites which was attended by 60 + people, creating a video series with 1000 views, and managing a booth called "Kardashev Klash" at the National Astronomy Carnival. 

More than that, we were Singapore's National Coordinators for UN World Space Week 2020 and coordinated with 7 clubs in Singapore to organize their respective World Space Week Event, including Science Center and Astronomy.sg. 

I believe that science is useless if it's not communicated properly, and these initiatives were my attempt at  inculcating an appreciation for physics in my community. I continued this journey in college where I served at the 2022-23 President for Penn Astronomical Student Association and organised stargazing sessions.
