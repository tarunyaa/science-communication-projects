## Science Communication Projects 🗣

### TEDxPenn ❤️🖤
TEDxPenn holds a special place in my heart purely because it's sole purpose is to spread knowledge without any ulterior motive. I love to learn for the sake of learning and enable that for other's too. It's what I did in my experience at the Director of Speaker & Content of TEDxPenn 2023 as I organised speaker recruitment and speech drafting. We were able to bring on board speakers like filmaker Anthony Russo, Pennsylvania State Representative Jordan Harris, and CNN Top 10 Hero Dr. Ala Stanford. This year, I'm the Co-Curator and I'm so excited to bring back the largest student-run conference in the US for another year. 

Oh and I also gave my own TEDx talk in the 8th grade - its a bit embarassing to watch it now but it was an essential part of my journey as a public speaker and a lover of the pursuit of knowledge.

### Physics Society, World Space Week & Penn Astronomical Student Association ⭐️
I founded and led the Physics Society in my high school and our goal was to foster understanding about scientific phenomena in anyone and everyone interested. We did that by organizing educational stargazing sessions, conducting a webinar on nanosatellites, creating a video series, and managing a booth called "Kardashev Klash" at the National Astronomy Carnival. 

More than that, we were Singapore's National Coordinators for UN World Space Week 2020 and coordinated with 7 clubs in Singapore to organize their respective World Space Week Event, including Science Center and Astronomy.sg. 

I believe that science is useless if it's not communicated properly, and these initiatives were my attempt at  inculcating an appreciation for physics in my community. I continued this journey in college where I served at the 2022-23 President for Penn Astronomical Student Association and organised stargazing sessions.

### Quantum Computing 💻
I interned at Atom Computing where I studied quantum computing and information theory and collected information of quantum computing frontends for the Principal Quantum Scientist. More than that, I gave a talk for Progressive's 2022 Network of Empowered Women Takes Your Daughter to IT Day. I worked on the presentation with phD Physicists and my friends to simplify a topic as complicated as quantum computing.

### GALxZ 👧
I co-founded and co-led GALxZ with the mission of insping girls to learn physics by promoting its beauty and relevance. Why physics? It's because physics is often seen as ‘the place for the genius’ and a ‘boy’s subject.’ Young girls often lack a sense of belonging in the field, hindering the development of their identity in Physics. The resulting gender disparity deprives the world of fresh perspectives that can be used to solve pertinent global issues and achieve a better understanding of our reality. 

We achieved our mission done by building a network of 30 Ambassadors and 150 Youth Members across 9 countries, organizing a webinar, organizing a creative writing competition and online Discord community, and disseminating lesson plans, factoids and creative writing content. Building the GALxZ family was one of the most fulfilling experiences I've had in my life.

### Model UN 📚
Model UN was what transformed me from a shy kid to a loud and vivacious one. I attended many conferences growing up and then served as the Under-Secretary-General of Academics for NPSiMUN 2020. I loved vetting study guides and learning more about global issues through debate and academic writing. I'm still pursuing this passion through Penn's Mode UN Conferences and their Intercollegiate Travelling Team.
