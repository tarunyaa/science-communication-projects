### TEDxPenn ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§
TEDxPenn holds a special place in my heart purely because it's sole purpose is to spread knowledge without any ulterior motive. I love to learn for the sake of learning and enable that for other's too. It's what I did in my experience at the Director of Speaker & Content in 2023 where I organised speaker recruitment and speech drafting. We were able to bring on board speakers like filmaker Anthony Russo, Pennsylvania State Representative Jordan Harris, and CNN Top 10 Hero Dr. Ala Stanford. This year, I'm the Co-Curator and I'm so excited to bring the largest student-run conference in the US back again for another year. 

Oh and I also gave my own TEDx talk when I was in the 8th grade - its a bit embarassing to watch it now but it was an essential part of my journey as a public speaker and a proponent of the pure pursuit of knowledge.

### Physics Society, World Space Week & Penn Astronomical Student Association
I founded and led the Physics Society in my high school and our goal is to foster understanding about scientific phenomena in anyone and everyone interested. We did that by organizing educational stargazing sessions attended by 100 people, conducting a webinar on nanosatellites which was attended by 60 + people, creating a video series, "The Unknown" with 1000 views, and managing booth called "Kardashev Klash" at the National Astronomy Carnival, Astrofest. Event attended by 1000 people. More than that, we were Singapore's National Coordinators for UN World Space Week 2020 and coordinated with 7 clubs in Singapore to organize their respective World Space Week Event, including Science Center and Astronomy.sg. I believe that science is useless if it's not communicated properly, and these initiatives were my attempt at inculcating responsibility for inculcating an appreciation for physics in my community. I continued this journey in college where I served at the President for Penn Astronomical Student Association for one year and helped organise stargazing sessions.
